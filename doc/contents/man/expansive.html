<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>Expansive</B> is a fast and flexible static web site generator.  It quickly
       creates HTML pages from layouts, partials and content pages.  Expansive
       brings dynamic content to static web sites.


       Expansive includes flexible tooling so  you  can  build  your  site  in
       development  mode and painlessly switch to production mode for release.
       It will minify, compress and bundle your site for easy deployment.




</PRE>
<H2>WHY EXPANSIVE?</H2><PRE>
       There are many web site site generators, why another one? Most existing
       site  generators are slow, often painfully slow.  When creating or man-
       aging a web site, you need tools that do not delay the creative  design
       process.  They need to be as fast as possible. Expansive is designed to
       be fast, without sacrificing features.



</PRE>
<H2>FEATURES</H2><PRE>
       Expansive generates static web sites from pages, layouts, partials  and



</PRE>
<H2>NICE PARTS</H2><PRE>
       While Expansive has a strong feature set, there are  some  characteris-
       tics that make Expansive particularly sweet.

           . Fast, fast, fast
           . Embedded Ejscript for server-side Javascript in every page
           . Easy to create and install new plugins
           . Great diagnostics when things go wrong




</PRE>
<H2>BASIC USAGE</H2><PRE>
       To  prepare a directory for expansive and create an expansive.json con-
       figuration file:

           expansive init

       To install new plugins to transform content, use the Pak  command.  The
       exp-less compiles *.less into css.

           pak install exp-less

       To  render a site from 'contents' into 'dist'. This processes web pages
       under the 'contents' directory into the 'dist'  directory  for  produc-
       tion.

           expansive render

       To serve content and watch for changes

           expansive serve

       or
           expansive

       To watch for changes but not serve

           expansive watch

       To render a matching set of files

           expansive contents/index.html
           expansive contents/manual

       To deploy a rendered site

           expansive deploy directory

       To clean the rendered site under 'dist'


       These  directories can be modified via meta 'directories' collection in
       the package.json file.



</PRE>
<H2>PROCESSING</H2><PRE>
       Expansive operates by processing web  pages  from  the  'contents'  and
       'lib'  directories.  It  uses layout pages from the 'layouts' directory
       and includes partial pages from the 'partials'  directory.   Raw  files
       may be copied from the 'files' directory. Documents are rendered to the
       'dist' output directory.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2><PRE>
       Expansive is controlled by an 'expansive.json' configuration file. This
       defines top level configuration for the site and controls how Expansive
       renders the site. An expansive.json file must be present for  Expansive
       to render content.

       To prepare a new site to use Expansive, run:

           expansive init


       This  creates  an  expansive.json  and  package.json  file.  The expan-
       sive.json file controls Expansive execution. The package.json  file  is
       used by the Pak manager when installing or managing extension packages.

             {
                 meta: {
                     site: 'http://example.com',
                     sitemap: {
                        files: [
                            '**.html',
                            !**unsupported.html'
                        ]
                    }
                 },
                 control: {
                     copy: [ 'images' ],
                     listen: '127.0.0.1:4800'
                 }
             }

       Expansive uses a liberal json format that  permits  comments,  unquoted
       property  keys  and  use  of  multi-line quotes. The layout and partial
       page. The 'control' collection has properties that control  the  opera-
       tion of Expansive. These values are made available to web pages via the
       'expansive.control' property.


       In the 'control' section, the 'documents' array defines the set of pat-
       For example, to render the current date in a document:

        &lt;;p&gt;;Today is &lt;;@ write(Date()) @&gt;;

       The write function is used to render data to be used in place of the &lt;;@
       @&gt;; element.  You can use 'writeSafe' to HTML  escape  the  data  before
       writing.  You can also use a simpler form &lt;;@= that means use the result
       of the Javascript expression, HTML escapse the data and then write  it.
       For example:

        &lt;;p&gt;;Today is &lt;;@= Date() @&gt;;

       Even  simpler, you can use an abbreviated @= variable to emit the value
       of a Javascript variable. For example:

        &lt;;p&gt;;Site URL is @={meta.site}&lt;;/p&gt;;

       The top URL of the site may be abbreviated as '@~'.



</PRE>
<H2>TRANSFORMATIONS</H2><PRE>
       Expansive will interpret document extensions and  automatically  trans-
       form  content  from  one  format to another.  For example, the filename
       'instructions.html.md' tells Expansive that the  data  is  in  Markdown
       format  via  the  '.md' extension and it should be converted to 'html'.
       Expansive will examine each nested extension and process  the  document
       until it reaches an extension for which there is no further transforma-
       tions defined.

       Expansive uses the '.exp' extension to specify the document has  embed-
       ded Javascript. For example:

            index.html.md.exp

       This  means  the  file  has Embedded Javascript in a Markdown file that
       will be compiled to HTML. Expansive will process this by first  running
       the  embedded  Javascript,  then piping the result through the Markdown
       filter and finally saving the result as 'index.html'.

       The transformation pipeline for specific extensions can  be  overridden
       via the 'expansive.transforms' meta property.



</PRE>
<H2>PLUGINS</H2><PRE>
       Expansive  may be extended via plugins that provide transformations and
       additional scripting capability.  Plugins are installed using  the  Pak
       manager via 'pak install NAMES...'. Once installed, expansive will load
       all installed plugin packages.



</PRE>
<H2>USEFUL PLUGINS</H2><PRE>
       Here are some of the more useful Expansive plugins:

       exp-less  Process Less stylesheets into CSS. Requires  'recess'  to  be
                 installed.

       exp-md    Process Markdown files and emit html.

       exp-sass  Process SASS files into CSS. Requires "sass" to be installed.

       Many plugins can be customized by passing configuration to  the  plugin
       via  expansive.json  file.  For example: To request that all Javascript
       files be minified, use a '.min.js' extension, and be compressed but not
       managed:

        {
            services: {
                'minify-js': {
                    compress: true,
                    mangle: true,
                    dotmin: true
                }
            }
        }


       See  specific  plugin  documentation  for the configuration options for
       each plugin.



</PRE>
<H2>LAYOUTS</H2><PRE>
       A layout page defines the top level HTML content for a  set  of  pages.
       The  layout  defines  the format, look and feel of the web site so that
       each pages does not need to replicate this content. Document pages nom-
       inate  a layout page to use, and the layout page then wraps the content
       page to create a composite page.  The '&lt;;@ content @&gt;;' tag in the layout
       is  replaced  with  the web page content after separating the page meta
       data.

       There can be multiple layout pages and the  default  layout  is  called
       'default.html.exp'.  This  may be modified by setting the 'layout' meta
       property to an alternate layout name. Set to '' to disable layout  pro-
       cessing.  Layout pages may nest, i.e. may use other layout pages.  Lay-
       out pages can use any desired transformation file extension.

             &lt;;!DOCTYPE html&gt;;
             &lt;;html lang="en"&gt;;
             &lt;;head&gt;;
                 &lt;;title&gt;;&lt;;@= meta.title @&gt;;&lt;;/title&gt;;
                 &lt;;link href="css/api.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;;
             &lt;;/head&gt;;
             &lt;;body&gt;;
                 &lt;;div class="content"&gt;;
                     &lt;;@ content @&gt;;

       The partial function will search for a file starting with 'header.html'
       in the 'partials' directory.  Partials  are  transformed  according  to
       their  extension.  If  a partial called 'header.html.md.exp' was found,
       then it will be first transformed by running the  embedded  Javascript,
       then  piping the output into the Markdown to create html data that will
       then be included in place of the original partial tag.


       Partials can be nested, in that a partial page may include another par-
       ital page to any depth.



</PRE>
<H2>META DATA</H2><PRE>
       Pages, layouts and partials can define meta data at the top of the file
       via a Javascript literal.  Meta data is passed to the Javascript execu-
       tion  context for each page, layout and partial where scripts can exam-
       ine and use in rendering pages.

             {
                draft: true,
                navigation: 'blog',
             }
             &lt;;h1&gt;;Page Header&lt;;/h1&gt;;

       The meta data is added to the current meta  data  collection  from  the
       expansive.json  file  and passed to the layout page, partials pages and
       content pages. The meta data can be  accessed  via  the  global  'meta'
       Javascript variable.


       Meta data is inherited and aggregated as Expansive processes a web site
       directory. In each directory, a site  may  define  an  'expansive.json'
       file  that  provides additional meta data for that directory level. The
       meta data from upper directories is passed down to  lower  directories.
       In  this  manner upper levels can define the parameters for subdirecto-
       ries in the site. Meta data is never passed back up the tree.



</PRE>
<H2>META PROPERTIES</H2><PRE>
       Expansive defines a rich set of meta properties for you to use in  your
       pages:

       date        Generation date of the document.

       description Description of the web site. Sourced from the 'description'
                   property in the package.json file.

       dest        Final destination name of the rendered document or file  in
                   the 'dist' directory.

       document    Input  file  name of the document being processed. For par-
                   tials and layouts, this is set to the invoking document.

       mode        Index name in the pak.modes property. The selected property
                   collection is copied up to the top level of the meta  data.
                   This  may be used to select a "debug" or "release" configu-
                   ration.

       partial     Name of the partial page being processed.

       path        Destination filename of the document relative to  the  dist
                   directory.

       service     Name of the transformation service being run.

       site        URL for the home page of the web site.

       sitemap     Control  what  files  to  include in a sitemap. If defined,
                   Expansive will by default include all  HTML  files  in  the
                   sitemap.   To  change the file set included in the sitemap,
                   define a 'files' property with an array of patterns in  the
                   sitemap object.

                   sitemap: {
                      files: [ '**.html', '!draft.html' ],
                   }

       source      Current  input  source file being processed. May be a docu-
                   ment, partial, layout or any input resource file.  Includes
                   the
                       contents, lib, layouts or partials directory.

       sourcePath  Source  filename relative to the contents, lib, layouts, or
                   partials directories.

       title       Title of the web site. Sourced from the 'title' property in
                   the package.json file.

       to          The  destination filename extension after processing by the
                   current transformation.

       top         URL for the top level home page of the site.

       url         URL for the current page.



</PRE>
<H2>EXPANSIVE CONTROL</H2><PRE>
       Expansive defines a set of control  properites  in  the  meta.expansive
       property.  These  are originally sourced from the 'control' property in
       the 'expansive.json' file.

       copy        Array of patterns to copy without processing. The  patterns
                   may  include  "*"  or "**". If a directory is specifed, all
                   files under the directory are copied. The files  are  rela-
                   tive to the 'contents' directory.


       transforms  Hash  of extension mappings to a list of transform services
                   for those mappings. Mappings are in the form 'ext -&gt;;  ext'.
                   For example:

                    transforms: {
                       'less -&gt;; css': [
                           'compile-less',
                           'prefix-css',
                           'minify-css',
                           'compress'
                       ]
                    }

                   Some  of  the standard service names are: compile-esp, com-
                   pile-less,   compile-markdown,   compile-sass,    compress,
                   minify-css, minify-js, prefix-css, shell.


       watch       Time  in  milliseconds to wait between checking for render-
                   ing.



</PRE>
<H2>CREATING PLUGINS</H2><PRE>
       Expansive   plugins    are    created    using    the    Pak    utility
       (https://embedthis.com/pak)   and  published  to  the  Pak  Catalog  at
       (https://embedthis.com/catalog/). The plugin contains an expansive.json
       file that includes transforms relevant to the plugin.  For example:

        {
           expansive: {
               transforms: {
                   name:   'my-transform',
                   mappings:  {
                       ext1: 'ext2',
                   },
                   script: '
                       function transform(contents, meta, service) {
                           return transformed data
                       }
                   '
               }
           }
        }


       The plugin specifies a one or more transformations via the 'transforms'
       collection. Each transform definition provides  an  implemention  of  a
       transform  service. The 'name' property specifies the transform service
       name. The service name provides an abstract  name  for  which  multiple
       plugins may provide the implementation.
       'script' that will be injected into the global scope of Expansive  when
       it executes.

       Web  sites may configure services via properties in the expansive.json.
       For example:

        {
           services: {
               compress: false
               minfiy-css: {
                   minify: true
               }
           }
        }

       Configuration for a service can be specified in a  property  collection
       named for the service. If the service name is set to false, the service
       is disabled. See the plugin specific README documentation for supported
       configuration properties for each service.



</PRE>
<H2>SCRIPTING</H2><PRE>
       Expansive  defines a Javascript global "expansive" to access and manage
       Expansive services. This object provides the following methods:


       addItems(collection, items)
              Add items  to  a  named  collection.  Collections  are  globally
              defined  and reset at the start of processing for each document.
              Documents, partials and layouts can inject  items  into  collec-
              tions  for  sharing to other documents. Items may be a string or
              an array of strings. Items are uniquely added to the collection.

       getFiles({key: value})
              To  return  a  list  of  matching  documents that have meta data
              matching the specified keys and values.

       getFileMeta(filename)
              To return the meta data specified in the given file.

       getItems(collection)
              Return the items in a named collection as an Array.

       removeItems(collection, items)
              Remove the specified items from the named collection.

       renderScripts
              Render  all  scripts  added  to  the  'scripts'  collection  via
              'addItems'.  This  permits  documents,  partials  and layouts to
              require Javascripts and have them emitted uniquely by a partial.
              Requires the exp-js plugin.

              'dist', 'cache', and expansive.json to 'deploy'.

       init   Initialize  a directory by creating an 'expansive.json' configu-
              ration file.

       install
              Install a plugin from the Pak catalog.

       list   List the installed and uninstalled plugins and packages.

       render Render the site by processing files from 'contents',  'layouts',
              'partials' and 'files' into the 'dist' output directory.

       uninstall
              Uninstall  a  plugin  from  the  expansive.json plugin list. The
              plugin remains in the local Pak cache.

       upgrade
              Upgrade a plugin version in the local Pak cache.

       watch  Watch for changes to 'contents', 'layouts'  and  'partials'  and
              render the modified files. Changes to 'layouts' or

       serve  Serve  the  web  site.  By default Expansive will listen on port
              4000. This can be modified via the 'listen' property in the meta
              collection.  Running expansive without any arguments is the same
              as "expansive serve".

       patterns ...
              Providing a list of patterns to filter the set of  documents  to
              render.   Expansive  will  render  only the documents that begin
              with the given patterns.

                 verbosity level from 0-5 with 5 being the most verbose.  HTTP
                 requests and HTTP headers will be traced at levels 2-4.
